# React Development
- `yarn start` to start the development server
  - reload with `r`
- `yarn android` to build the android app (dev server needs to be running), only needed when 
dependencies in package.json or native source changes
- If you get `Could not initialize class org.codehaus.groovy.reflection.ReflectionCache`: Need to lower JDK version (tested with JDK 11)
